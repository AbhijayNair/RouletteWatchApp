# Progress Journal

This journal contains key insights, commits and other notes from each day that I worked on this app.

# June 17 2024
- Started out by downloading the target vesrion for the preview, iOS 17.5; had to restart my system a couple of times to since I thought I needed to update my mac to the latest
version to get things running; Turns out, I hadn't downloaded the required target from Xcode settings. Just newbie things :P
- Added the ZStack scroll view for the home screen. I think the regular list view as Apple uses in their workout app makes more sense as you can see the other options. But I guess this works too, looks kinda clean, and lesser screen transitions. I should probably stop here today and think of the UI for the roulette picker. I am planning to do a red-blue coint toss, the background color will keep alternating between red and blue for 3 ticks before randomly picking either red or blue. Still need to decide how it's gonna look, so good luck to me lol.

# June 18 2024
- Well, today wasn't exactly what you would call a really productive day. I lazed through the first half of the day and practically forced myself to open Xcode and start working on the app.
- So, all I did today was switch up the UI a bit, and added titles to the screen using the NavigationStack view.
- Also added two buttons to the roulette app to either join or create a room. This would be the entry point to the prominent part of this watch app so I'm gonna start working on it tomorrow. Probaly after reading a bit more about the networking docs and looking at some code on github :P.
- Finally, I'll push this to a git repository since I forgot to do that yesterday. I hope this journal will remind me to push the changes everyday. I am estimating less than 7 days worth of effort for this watch app so I guess six more commits to go!
